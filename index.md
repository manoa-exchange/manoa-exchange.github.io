## Description

### Problem Statement

There are students who want to travel abroad, but have no prior experience, and there are students who have traveled abroad with lots of experience. These people donâ€™t have a dedicated platform to interact with each other, leading prospective exchange students to have unrealistic perceptions of a given study abroad program.

### Our Solution

Our solution is a peer-to-peer study abroad experience sharing site which is an application designed for UH Manoa students to post about the experiences they had in traveling/studying in other countries. This enables and promotes student discussion on the topic of studying abroad.

### Concept Landing

## Goals

Our aim is to make it easier for prospective study abroad students and former/current study abroad students to connect and share experiences with the ultimate goal of creating a realistic perception of UH Manoa's available exchange programs.
